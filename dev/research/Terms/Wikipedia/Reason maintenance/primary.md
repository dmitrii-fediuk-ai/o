#
**Reason maintenance** is a **knowledge representation approach** to **efficient handling** of **inferred information** that is **explicitly stored**. 

#
Reason maintenance **distinguishes** between **base facts**, which **can be defeated**, and **derived facts**.

#
As such it **differs from belief revision** which, in its basic form, **assumes** that **all facts are equally important**
